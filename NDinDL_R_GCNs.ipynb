    "## Introduction\n",
    "Graphs are used to model and analyze a variety of phenomena – be it social networks, protein-protein interactions or citation networks. These are rather irregular in comparison to regular structures like sequences or grids, which can be represented as a graph as well. Popular Machine Learning models have been tailored to these regular forms of graphs, specifically Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) (Rumelhart et al., 1986a) for sequences (e.g. sentences, time series) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (LeCun, 1989) for grids (e.g. images). To be able to deal with general graphs however, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) were devised (Hamilton, 2020, p. 47-48). GNNs base upon a differentiable message passing scheme, i.e. vector messages are passed between nodes and updated using neural networks (Hamilton, 2020, p. 48). In this project, the focus is on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) (Kipf & Welling, 2016), but before going into detail, we will first define some important terms and illustrate potential use cases as well as previous approaches."

    "## Background \n",
    "\n",
    "A graph is commonly defined as a tuple $G = (V, E)$ where $V$ denotes the set of vertices and $E \\subseteq V \\times V$ is the set of edges between vertices. The edge relation is typically represented as an adjacency matrix $M$ where $M_{i,j} = 1$ iff $(i,j) \\in E$. One or more features may be assigned to the vertices and/or edges in a graph. Nodes may further be encoded in the form of embeddings, i.e., as \"low-dimensional vectors that summarize their graph position and the structure in their local neighborhood\" (Hamilton, 2020, p. 29). Hence, node features describe the properties of the respective node in the given graph, thus are given explicitly, whereas a node embedding represents a node in a latent space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common tasks related to graphs are node classification, link prediction, graph classification and community detection (Hamilton, 2020, p. 4-8). In this seminar project, we will focus on node classification using Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (R-GCN). Node classification refers to predicting the labels for a set of unlabelled nodes in a graph, given a (usually rather small) set of labelled nodes of the same graph (Hamilton, 2020, p.5). \\\\\n",
    "Originally, this was achieved by assigning some kind of node-level statistics like the node degree to each node and using these as input features to a standard machine learning classifier (Hamilton, 2020, p. 9-13). Another approach consists in *encoding* nodes as so-classed shallow embeddings, which are computed for each node uniquely, and then reconstructing graph characteristics, like an edge between two nodes, from these embeddings (corresponding to a *decoding* step, e.g. based on random walks)  (Hamilton, 2020, p. 29-35). \\\\\n",
    "However, shallow embeddings have some major shortcomings  (Hamilton, 2020, p. 36-37): they do not allow for parameter sharing, which would improve the computational efficiency and constitute a form of regularization. They further do not incorporate the graph structure or feature information, which could improve the quality of the embeddings. Lastly, they cannot generalize to nodes unseen during the training. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) tackle these deficiencies, and thus enable the computation of more sophisticated embeddings that can be used to classify nodes or predict links (Hamilton, 2020, p. 37). In the following, we are going to elaborate on (Relational) Graph Convolutional Networks in order to understand their applicability to the problem of node classification."

    "## Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)\n",
    "Kipf & Welling (2016) proposed Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) that make use of a first-order approximation of spectral graph convolutions. In essence, that corresponds to the aforementioned message passing mechanism enhanced with symmetric normalization, i.e. the representation of a node $i$ is computed by aggregating and normalizing the information held by its neighbors $N_i$ and combining the result with $i$'s previous representation. Accordingly, a GCN layer consists of normalized message passing operations, followed by a non-linear activation. This idea is condensed in the following formula which represents the update of node $i$ in layer $l+1$:\n",
    "> $h_i^{l+1} = \\sigma\\left(\\sum_{j\\in N_i}{c_{i,j}}W_i^{(l)^T}h_j^{(l)}+\\underbrace{W_0^{(l)^T}h_i^{(l)}}_{\\text{self-connection}}\\right)$\n",
    "\n",
    "In detail, a hidden state $h_i^{l+1}$ of a node $i$ in layer $l+1$ is computed by\n",
    "- (a)\tAggregating the hidden states $h_j$ of the neighbouring nodes $j \\in N_i$ by summing up the products of each hidden state $h_j$ with\n",
    "  - a learnable $d_l \\times d_{l+1}$ parameter matrix $W_1^{(l)}$ and\n",
    "  - normalization constant $c_{i,j}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{D_{i,i}D_{j,j}}}$ where $D_{i,i}$ is the node degree of node $i$. The normalization constant is particularly important, since it reduces the impact of high node degrees.\n",
    "- (b)\tApplying another $d_l \\times d_{l+1}$ parameter matrix $W_0^{(l)}$ to the hidden state $h_i$ of node $i$ in layer $l$ (which corresponds to adding a self-loop) and adding that to the overall aggregated value \n",
    "- (c)\tApplying an element-wise non-linear activation function $\\sigma$ like ReLu to the overall result\n",
    "- (d)\tAssigning the result to node $h_i$ as its hidden state in layer $l+1$\n",
    "\n",
    "To construct a $n$-layer GCN, these steps are repeated $n$ times for each node in parallel by using the output of the $i$-th layer as the input of the $i+1$-th layer. The original node features serve as input to the first layer, and the output of the last layer is simultaneously the output of the overall GCN. Stacking the layers in that way captures dependencies across several relational steps, i.e. after k layers, a node embedding incorporates information, both structural and feature-based, of its k-hop neighbourhood (Hamilton, 2020). These so-called vanilla GCNs are an example of *Isotropic* Graph Neural Networks, i.e. when calculating the hidden state for each node, each of its neighbors is included with equal weight (Dwivedi et al., 2020)."

    "## Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (R-GCNs)\n",
    "In this seminar, we employed an advancement of GCNs, namely Relational GCNs (R-GCNs) that was proposed by Schlichtkrull et al. (2018). R-GCNs support multi-relational data, i.e. graphs with a type assigned to each edge. A common example of such data are knowledge graphs (like DBPedia or Wikidata), which may be conceived as a collection of triples *(subject, predicate, object)*. Subject and object correspond to typed entities and the predicate denotes the relation type. A proper representation of knowledge graphs are directed, labeled multigraphs with entities as nodes and triples determining the edge relation.\\\n",
    "To support this kind of data, the previously presented computation of a layer is enhanced by using a separate weight matrix $W_r^{(l)}$ for each relation type $r \\in R$. Broadly speaking, the hidden states of neighbouring nodes are separately transformed for each relation type and direction of an edge. The node in question is also transformed separately (corresponding to a self-loop). These transformations are then aggregated in a normalized manner and passed through an activation function. This computation is individually performed for each node in the graph. The following formula comprises the node update for a node $i$ in layer $l+1$:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $h_i^{l+1} = \\sigma\\left(\\sum_{r\\in R}\\sum_{j\\in N^r_i}\\frac{1}{c_{i,r}}W_r^{(l)}h_j^{(l)}+\\underbrace{W_0^{(l)}h_i^{(l)}}_{\\text{self-connection}}\\right)$\n",

    "#### Regularization\n",
    "In the corresponding work, Schlichtkrull et al. (2018) further present regularization techniques in the form of basis decomposition and block-diagonal decomposition. Regularization of the weights in R-GCN layers is needed due to the increasing number of parameters with the number of relations in the graph which could lead to overfitting and large models. For that reason, Schlichtkrull et al. leveraged basis decomposition of the relation-specific weight matrices as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $W_r^{(l)} = \\sum^B_{b=1}a^{(l)}_{r,b}V_b^{(l)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The relation-specific matrices are thus represented as linear combinations of basis transformations $V_b^{(l)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d^{(l+1)}\\times d^{(l)}}$ with learnable coefficients $a^{(l)}_{r,b}$ such that only the coefficients have to be adapted for each $r \\in R$ and not the complete weight matrix as previously . $B$, the number of basis functions, is a hyperparameter. The basis decomposition acts as a weight sharing mechanism between different relation types, such that the number of parameters that need to be learned is reduced. Schlichtkrull et al. further assume that basis decomposition can avert the risk of overfitting on rare relations due to the parameter sharing between rare and frequent relations. In addition to that, Schlichtkrull et al. also suggest employing block-diagonal decomposition. That means, the weight matrix $W_r^{(l)}$ is represented as a block-diagonal matrix: \n",
    "\n",
    "> $W_r^{(l)} = \\bigoplus_{b=1}^{B}Q_{br}^{(l)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\bigoplus$ denotes the direct sum of matrices and $Q_{br}^{(l)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(d^{(l+1)}/B)\\times (d^{(l)}/B)}$. Besides also reducing the number of parameters needed, this regularization mechanism forces each weight matrix $W_r^{(l)}$ to be sparse to some extent and intuitively groups related latent features (Schlichtkrull, 2018)."

    "During the initialization of an R-GCN layer, everything is set up for basis decomposition. To achieve quicker convergence and higher accuracy, we employ Xavier initialization to initialize the trainable parameters (Dellinger, 2019). We use the recommmended gain value for the given non-linearity function (here: ReLu), which is an optional scaling factor. We also give the user the opportunity to define a dropout probability, although we do not use it in the experiments. Dropout is yet another regularization technique that essentially refers to randomly dropping units during the training of a neural network (Srivastava, 2014). That way, overfitting can be mitigated."

For this purpose, we relied on the same datasets that Schlichtkrull et al. (2018) used in their experiments. In particular, they used the datasets *AM*, *BGS*, *AIFB* and *MUTAG*. These datasets are part of a benchmark for evaluating machine learning approaches in the context of the semantic web (Ristoski, 2016). Relations in those datasets do not necessarily represent the triples of the knowledge graph only but may also provide information on the presence or absence of a feature.

    "The *AM* dataset describes artifacts maintained by the Amsterdam Museum, where each artifact refers to metadata on its production, material and content. Each artifact may also be linked to other artifacts and is further labelled with an artifact category, which is used for classification in this case. Ristoski et al. (2016) drew and pre-processed a stratitified random sample of 1000 instances from the complete dataset before including it in the benchmark in its current form. The pre-processing consisted in omitting a relation due to its high correlation with the artifact category. \n",

    "The *BGS* dataset contains geological measurements on so-called named rock units that were collected by the British Geological Survey. Various properties are assigned to these named rock units that describe rock formations (see https://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/MTON for an example of such a named rock unit). In this case, the so-called lithogenetic type, the \"mode of origin\" (British Geological Survey, 2021) of rock formations, is used to divide the rock units into different classes. The rock units belonging to the two largest lithogenesis classes, namely \"GLACI\" (glacial) and \"FLUV\" (fluviatile) (\"Lithogenesis types\", 2013; \"BGS/readme.txt\", 2015), form the *BGS* dataset as it was used by de Vries et al. (2013) and then adopted by Ristoski et al. (2016) in their proposed benchmark. Thus, the dataset encompasses 146 named\n",

    "R-GCNs are limited with respect to several aspects (Hamilton, 2020): \n",
    "1. *Limited Support for edge features*: They do not support all kinds of edge features. To be specific, they only support discrete edge features, i.e., edge types.\n",
    "2. *Over-Smoothing*: Several iterations of the GNN message passing procedure may lead to node embeddings becoming very similar to each other, when the information from neighborhood aggregation dominates the update of the node representation. This poses a problem when building deep GNNs that aim at capturing longer-term dependencies.\n",
    "3. *Same normalization constants for all neighbors*: Currently, the same normalization constant is used for each neighbor during the update of a node presentation, so we cannot treat neighbors with varying significance differently.\n"

    "Several extensions tackle the aforementioned deficiencies. For example, attention-based approaches like Graph Attention Networks (Veličković, 2017) replace normalization constants with learned attention weights, which addresses issue (2) from the previous section. Deep GCNs (Li, 2019) address issue (3) from the previous section by using some tricks to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and thus, enable the exploitation of long-term dependencies."

    "GNNs are put to use in various application fields: for example in machine translation, where they are used together with dependency graphs to create embeddings enriched with syntactic information (Bastings, 2017). Recommender systems constitute another application area of GNNs, since user-to-item interaction graphs and social graphs can be leveraged. Item embeddings may be learned and used for item-item recommendation, in order to recommend themed collections (e.g. playlists, “feed” content) (Ying, 2018)."

    "## Summary\n",
    "In this seminar project, we presented the mechanics of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) as well as their extension, Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (R-GCNs). Both build upon the same message passing mechanism: in each iteration (layer), every node aggregates information from its local neighborhood in parallel. The more iterations pass, the more information the nodes can gather from further reaches of the graph. The R-GCN introduces the relation-specific aggregation and normalization in order to deal with multi-relational data. We implemented a R-GCN and evaluated it on the datasets AIFB and MUTAG, that were also used in the original paper (Schlichtkrull, 2018). Similar results to those reported in the original paper were achieved."
